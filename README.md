# React recruitment task description

Your job is to create a simple master-slave widget displaying posts and its comments.
There is no visual restriction, make it look good :)
Use placeholder data from here:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
Requirements:

1. There should be an option to search/filter posts by title.
2. Comments should load on user interaction (eg. click on a post).
3. Use CodePen as playground and send us a link to your work once you're done. You can use any
   other platform of your choice, but please remember that:
   your widget should work out of the box (we should click link and be able to use it)
   we should be able to take a look at your code
   Hints:
4. We love new technologies. Show us your best knowledge of ES6, HTML5 and CSS3!
5. Using Javascript framework is not a requirement, but we like vue.js here.
6. Pay attention to code quality, formatting, conventions etc.
